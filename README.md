# Haiku-Fan-Script
This is a python script that can be used to control Haiku Fans over networks.

## How does it work?
It controlls the fans by simply creating a udp packet with certain infomation and sending it to the fan in question. As of now all this script does is turn on and off the fan and set it's speed but in futur I might add support for lights and other features.

## How to use
On linux just run ```python Haiku.py```

## Why did I make this
So I could remote control fans from my linux box.
